Goal is a lightweight utility belt for modern JavaScript developers. Contrary to popular solutions like Underscore or Lodash, Goal is only a fraction of the size. It also focuses on only replicating core functionality when needed, and assumes it's being run on a fully ES5-compliant JavaScript engine.

Goal can be run in node.js or in a browser (via Browserify).

Future goals
===

- More functional helpers (curry, etc).
- Optional lazy loading functionality.
